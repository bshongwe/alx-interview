# 0x09. Island Perimeter 🏝️

## Project Description 📜
This project involves solving the problem of calculating the perimeter of a single island in a grid. The grid is represented by a 2D array of integers where:
- `0` represents water.
- `1` represents land.
- Each cell is square, with a side length of 1.
- Cells are connected horizontally and vertically (not diagonally).
- The grid is rectangular, with dimensions not exceeding 100x100.
- The grid is completely surrounded by water.
- There is only one island or no island at all (no lakes).
<br></br>

To achieve this, the solution requires knowledge of:
- 2D Arrays (Matrices) 🔄
  - Accessing and iterating over elements in a 2D array.
  - Navigating through adjacent cells (horizontally and vertically).
<br></br>

- Conditional Logic 🛠️
  - Applying conditions to determine whether a cell contributes to the perimeter of the island.
<br></br>

- Counting Techniques 📊
  - Developing a method to count the edges that contribute to the island’s perimeter.
<br></br>

- Problem-Solving Strategies 💡
  - Breaking down the problem into smaller tasks, such as identifying land cells and calculating their contribution to the perimeter.
<br></br>

- Python Programming 🐍
  - Using nested loops for iterating over grid cells.
  - Using conditional statements to check the status of adjacent cells.
<br></br>

## Requirements 📋
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python3 (version 3.4.3).
- All your files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
- Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7).
- You are not allowed to import any module.
- All modules and functions must be documented.
- All your files must be executable.

## Tasks ✅
### 0. Island Perimeter 🏝️
Create a function `def island_perimeter(grid):` that returns the perimeter of
the island described in `grid`:

- `grid` is a list of list of integers:
  - `0` represents water.
  - `1` represents land.
  - Each cell is square, with a side length of 1.
  - Cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally).
  - `grid` is rectangular, with its width and height not exceeding 100.
- The grid is completely surrounded by water.
- There is only one island (or nothing).
- The island doesn’t have “lakes” (water inside that isn’t connected to the
water surrounding the island).

### Example 🌊

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
"""
0-main
"""
island_perimeter = __import__('0-island_perimeter').island_perimeter

if __name__ == "__main__":
    grid = [
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ]
    print(island_perimeter(grid))  # Output should be 12
```
