# üé≤ Project: 0x0A. Prime Game
`Algorithm` `Python`
<br></br>

## Overview
For this project, you will need to leverage your understanding of prime numbers, game theory, and algorithm optimization to solve a competitive game scenario. The challenge involves determining the winner of a game based on the strategic removal of prime numbers and their multiples from a set of consecutive integers.
<br></br>
<br></br>

## Concepts Needed
### Prime Numbers üßÆ
- Understanding what prime numbers are.
- Efficient algorithms for identifying prime numbers within a range.
<br></br>
### Sieve of Eratosthenes üè∫
- An efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit, which can be particularly useful for this task.
<br></br>
### Game Theory üé≤
- Basic principles of competitive games where players take turns and the concept of optimal play.
- Understanding win conditions and strategies that lead to a win or loss.
<br></br>
### Dynamic Programming/Memoization üß†
- Using previous results to make future calculations faster, potentially necessary for optimizing the solution for multiple rounds of the game.
<br></br>
### Python Programming üêç
- Loops and conditional statements for implementing game logic and algorithms.
- Arrays and lists for storing the integers and tracking removed numbers.
<br></br>

<br></br>

## Tasks üìù
### Task 0. Prime Game üé≤
**Mandatory**

Maria and Ben are playing a game. Given a set of consecutive integers starting
from 1 up to and including `n`, they take turns choosing a prime number from
the set and removing that number and its multiples from the set. The player
that cannot make a move loses the game.

They play `x` rounds of the game, where `n` may be different for each round.
Assuming Maria always goes first and both players play optimally, determine who
the winner of each game is.

#### Prototype

def isWinner(x, nums)
